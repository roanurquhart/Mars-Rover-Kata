# Welcome to the Mars Rover Kata in React!

This project leverages Typescript React to implement the Mars Rover Kata training<br> exercise

## Prerequisites

- Install NodeJS, the download can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Navigate to the project directory via the command prompt or the VS Code Terminal<br> and run `npm install` to set up the dependencies

## Starting the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

## Testing the Application

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
The package.json file points this command to run all of the Jest tests<br>
 - The Jest tests can be identified by their filename ending of `test.tsx`
 - When adding a test file be sure to include this file ending  

Due to the scaffolding of `create-react-app`, the configuration settings required<br> for some of the UI rendering tests are automatically reset whenever `npm start`<br> is run. In order to fix the test suite, reset the `jsx` setting in `tsconfig.json` from 'preserve' to 'react'.

 ## Building the Application

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
